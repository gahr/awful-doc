==== How does awful bind URIs to files/directories on the filesystem and procedures?

Explanation by example:

When a procedure is bound to a path {{a}} (like {{(define-page "a" (lambda ...))}}) and the request is made to {{a/}}, the awful behavior is the following:

* if the path {{a}} does not exist, the server replies with the result of the evaluation of the procedure bound to {{a}}.

* if {{a}} is an existent file, the server replies with the file contents (or the result of processing the file, in case it is a special one like [[/egg/spiffy#web-scheme-handler|web-scheme]] or {{.ssp}} files)

* if {{a}} is an existing directory and the directory contains one of the files in {{index-file}} (see documentation for [[/egg/spiffy|Spiffy]]), with the index file contents (or the result of processing the file, in case it is a special one like [[/egg/spiffy#web-scheme-handler|web-scheme]]'s or {{.ssp}})

* if {{a}} is an existing directory and does not contain index files, the server replies with the result of the evaluation of the  procedure bound to {{a}}.
