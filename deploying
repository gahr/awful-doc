=== Deploying Awful

Here are some tips about how to deploy awful on your system.


==== On Unix[-like] systems

Create a user for running awful.  For example, on GNU/Linux systems,
you can use the adduser program:

  # adduser --system --no-create-home --disabled-password --disabled-login --group awful

This will create a user and a group called {{awful}}.


Create a directory for the awful configuration file:

  # mkdir /etc/awful


Create a directory for log files:

  # mkdir /var/log/awful

Create a directory for static files:

  # mkdir /var/www/awful

You may also want to create a directory for your awful applications:

  # mkdir /var/lib/awful


Create configuration files for awful.  In the privileged configuration
file ({{privileged.conf}} below) you can set all the configuration
parameters for awful and spiffy which require administrator
provileges.

In another file ({{awful.conf}} below) you can put whatever code which
does not need administrator provileges.

Here's some example configuration for awful listening on port 80
(strictly speaking, [[/egg/spiffy|spiffy]] -- the actual web server --
listens on this port):

===== privileged.conf

<enscript highlight=scheme>
;; -*- scheme -*-

(use spiffy awful)
(spiffy-user "awful")
(server-port 80)
(root-path "/var/www/awful")
(debug-log "/var/log/awful/debug.log")
(error-log "/var/log/awful/error.log")
</enscript>


===== awful.conf
<enscript highlight=scheme>
(load "/var/lib/awful/my-app") ;; if you don't use file suffixes, Chicken will
                               ;; pick .so files when you compile your apps
</enscript>


Set the permissions for the configuration, log, static files and awful
applications directories:

  # chown -R awful:awful /etc/awful /var/log/awful /var/www/awful /var/lib/awful


Set up an init script for your system.  Basically, it should call

  /usr/bin/awful --privileged-code=/etc/awful/privileged.conf /etc/awful/awful.conf &> /var/log/awful/init.log &

If awful doesn't start, take a look at {{/var/log/awful/init.log}}

You can find an [[http://anonymous@code.call-cc.org/svn/chicken-eggs/release/4/awful/extra/awful-debian-init|init script]] for [[http://www.debian.org|Debian]] systems (or derivatives, like [[http://www.ubuntulinux.com|Ubuntu]]) at the [[http://anonymous@code.call-cc.org/svn/chicken-eggs/release/4/awful/trunk|awful source repository]].  Here are the steps to install it:

  # cd /etc/init.d
  # wget --user=anonymous --password='' http://code.call-cc.org/svn/chicken-eggs/release/4/awful/extra/awful-debian-init -O awful
  # chmod 755 awful
  # update-rc.d awful defaults

There's also an [[http://anonymous@code.call-cc.org/svn/chicken-eggs/release/4/awful/extra/awful-gentoo-init|init script for Gentoo]] (by [[/users/david-krentzlin|David Krentzlin]]).
